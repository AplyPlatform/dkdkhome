   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION<BR><BR>

   1. Definitions.<BR><BR>

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,<BR>
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.<BR><BR>

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by<BR>
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.<BR><BR>

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all<BR>
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common<BR>
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,<BR>
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the<BR>
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or<BR>
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the<BR>
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.<BR><BR>

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity<BR>
      exercising permissions granted by this License.<BR><BR>

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,<BR>
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation<BR>
      source, and configuration files.<BR><BR>

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical<BR>
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but<BR>
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,<BR>
      and conversions to other media types.<BR><BR>

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or<BR>
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a<BR>
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work<BR>
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).<BR><BR>

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object<BR>
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the<BR>
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications<BR>
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes<BR>
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain<BR>
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,<BR>
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.<BR><BR>

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including<BR>
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions<BR>
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally<BR>
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner<BR>
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of<BR>
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"<BR>
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent<BR>
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to<BR>
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,<BR>
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the<BR>
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but<BR>
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise<BR>
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."<BR><BR>

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity<BR>
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and<BR>
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.<BR><BR>

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of<BR>
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<BR>
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable<BR>
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,<BR>
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the<BR>
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.<BR><BR>

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of<BR>
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<BR>
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable<BR>
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,<BR>
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,<BR>
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable<BR>
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their<BR>
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)<BR>
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You<BR>
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<BR>
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work<BR>
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct<BR>
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses<BR>
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate<BR>
      as of the date such litigation is filed.<BR><BR>

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the<BR>
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without<BR>
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You<BR>
      meet the following conditions:<BR><BR>

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or<BR>
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and<BR><BR>

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices<BR>
          stating that You changed the files; and<BR><BR>

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<BR>
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<BR>
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,<BR>
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<BR>
          the Derivative Works; and<BR><BR>

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its<BR>
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must<BR>
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<BR>
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<BR>
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<BR>
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<BR>
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<BR>
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,<BR>
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and<BR>
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<BR>
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<BR>
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<BR>
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<BR>
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<BR>
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<BR>
          as modifying the License.<BR><BR>

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<BR>
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<BR>
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<BR>
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<BR>
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<BR>
      the conditions stated in this License.<BR><BR>

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<BR>
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<BR>
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<BR>
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<BR>
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<BR>
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<BR>
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<BR><BR>

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<BR>
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<BR>
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<BR>
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<BR><BR>

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<BR>
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<BR>
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<BR>
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<BR>
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<BR>
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<BR>
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<BR>
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<BR>
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<BR><BR>

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<BR>
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<BR>
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<BR>
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<BR>
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<BR>
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<BR>
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<BR>
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<BR>
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<BR>
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<BR>
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<BR><BR>

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<BR>
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<BR>
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<BR>
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<BR>
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<BR>
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<BR>
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<BR>
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<BR>
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<BR>
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<BR><BR>

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<BR><BR>

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.<BR><BR>

      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following<BR>
      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"<BR>
      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include<BR>
      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate<BR>
      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a<BR>
      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the<BR>
      same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier<BR>
      identification within third-party archives.<BR><BR>

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object<BR>
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the<BR>
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications<BR>
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes<BR>
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain<BR>
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,<BR>
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.<BR><BR>

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including<BR>
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions<BR>
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally<BR>
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner<BR>
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of<BR>
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"<BR>
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent<BR>
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to<BR>
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,<BR>
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the<BR>

      subsequently incorporated within the Work.<BR><BR>

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of<BR>
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<BR>
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable<BR>
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,<BR>
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the<BR>
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.<BR><BR>

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of<BR>
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<BR>

      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,<BR>
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,<BR>
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable<BR>
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their<BR>
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)<BR>
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You<BR>
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<BR>
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work<BR>
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct<BR>
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses<BR>
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate<BR>
      as of the date such litigation is filed.<BR><BR>

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the<BR>
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without<BR>
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You<BR>
      meet the following conditions:<BR><BR>

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or<BR>
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and<BR><BR>

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices<BR>
          stating that You changed the files; and<BR><BR>

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<BR>
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<BR>
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,<BR>
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<BR>
          the Derivative Works; and<BR><BR>

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its<BR>
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must<BR>
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<BR>
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<BR>
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<BR>
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<BR>
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<BR>
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,<BR>
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and<BR>
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<BR>
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<BR>
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<BR>
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<BR>
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<BR>
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<BR>
          as modifying the License.<BR><BR>

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<BR>
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<BR>
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<BR>
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<BR>
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<BR>
      the conditions stated in this License.<BR><BR>

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<BR>
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<BR>
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<BR>
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<BR>
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<BR>
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<BR>
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<BR><BR>

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<BR>
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<BR>
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<BR>
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<BR><BR>

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<BR>
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<BR>
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<BR>
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<BR>
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<BR>
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<BR>
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<BR>
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<BR>
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<BR><BR>

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<BR>
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<BR>
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<BR>
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<BR>
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<BR>
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<BR>
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<BR>
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<BR>
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<BR>
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<BR>
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<BR><BR>

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<BR>
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<BR>
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<BR>
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<BR>
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<BR>
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<BR>
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<BR>
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<BR>
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<BR>
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<BR><BR>
